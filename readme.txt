== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Can I update a column type once it is created?
	* Not currently. We have this on a feature list for next release
* Can I add individual users to admin a table?
	* YES! Add the username to the username field on the specific tables you wish to have someone admin. Once they log into the backend they will be able to edit that table they have permission for.
* Can I get reports on activity?
	* Yes! We have a CSV emailed to the admin on a weekly basis. This contains information on the amount of activity for a "download" type column.
* Can I update the CSS for the tables?
	* You can but the template CSS styles for TR TD TABLE will be used by default. If you have a template that does not have these styles then it will look wierd out of the box. We suggest you add bootstrap generic table CSS. We will have a styles selector override builtin future versions, so you may wish to just wait.
